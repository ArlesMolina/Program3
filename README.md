Rooted Trees and Graphs Analysis in C++ 


Description
In this project, I worked on the implementation and analysis of fundamental data structures, focusing on rooted trees and graphs. The main objective was to develop a C++ program that explores and verifies key characteristics of these structures.

Activities Performed
Definition and Structure of Rooted Trees: I implemented an algorithm that traverses a tree and verifies if it meets the definition of a rooted fir tree, where each non-leaf vertex has at least three leaf children. This process involved analyzing the structure of the vertices, the parent-child relationships, and counting the number of leaf children for each non-leaf vertex. I used traversal techniques such as DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore the tree structure.

Graph Theory: I also worked with the representation of graphs, where nodes (vertices) and edges (connections) formed the basis for modeling relationships between entities. I focused on cycles, trees, and connected components, implementing algorithms that helped identify these characteristics within a graph.

Connectivity and Components: Exploring graph connectivity was a key task. I defined and classified graphs as connected or disconnected based on whether isolated components (independent trees or subgraphs) existed. This was particularly useful for analyzing social networks or transportation systems modeled by graphs.

Identification of "Acorns": I identified isolated trees without edges, known as "acorns." This concept added complexity and diversity to the analysis of a forest, which is useful for identifying important structures or isolated points within a network.

Practical Applications: The results and techniques applied are relevant in fields such as social network analysis, transportation systems, and other areas where graph theory has practical applications. The ability to count trees and acorns in a forest is crucial for identifying key structures or isolated elements in a network.
